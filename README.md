# Employee Tracker

This *Employee Traacker* was built for Vanderbilt's online bootcamp to track, add, delete, and update fictional employees from a company database. This project was built using Node.js, MySQL, and Inquirer. The setting up of the database was slightly tricky at first and overall an interesting experience. I am excited to use the tools in future projects and designs.

## Installation

Use the following command to install the NPM's:

```bash
npm install
```
And use the following command to run the program in your terminal:
